# CloudMedicationDeliverySystem
#### What I've done:
 ##### - Develop and deploy 3 API services: Medication Order Service, Pharmacy Query API, and Medication Service. Both of all are using DDD principles
 ##### - Implement a service called Ocelot API as ApiGateway and configure upstream and downstream URLs
 ##### - Using Azure DevOps to plan a project adapting Scrum process, manage code, and deploy repos to the cloud by Azure Pipeline
 ##### - Using Microsoft Azure to set up the cloud services and deploy Azure Function to capture messages on the Service Bus topic trigger
